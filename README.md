# Paper-Dog-Dash
This is a hobby project that I work on for fun in my free time. I am open to suggestions and constructive criticism.

## Where to play
Play here: https://b0rked.itch.io/paper-dog or https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/921331

Now made in Godot 4. Our team originally submitted this game for the game jam "gamedevjs2023", but we wanted to move from JavaScript to Godot.
